Ecosystem simulation C#
-

   Project I'm making in spare time at home. Simulation will contain both abiotic and biotic components of ecosystem. 
   
   
   User will be able to manipulate the world as he pleases - not only modifying the numbers of animals and plants, 
   but bioms and terrain as well. 
   
   What will be implemented in code:
   - growth of plants and reproduction of animals
   - prey-hunter attacks for carnivores, depending on type of animals
   - hunger incrementing
   - herds of animals simulated by real life conditions
   - terrain with different properties and different animals possible to survive
   
and maybe more :)
